- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Aleksandra-Tester
- ðŸ‘€ I'm looking for opportunities to gain more commercial experience and work in software testing field. My passion always was to become a Software Tester. Although, I come from a non-IT background, I have taken the help of online resources and courses to work my way through the concepts. And as it is my dream to become one, I am positive that I would learn the concepts very fast, and get going with the team quickly.

     âœ”Writing test documentation,
     âœ” Reporting bugs,
     âœ” Software testing methods,
